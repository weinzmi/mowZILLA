# Hardware

in terms of hardware, the goal is to use out of the box modules. 
PCBs, dsicrete components (HMD, SMD,..) and soldering are not scope of this porject, even if costs could be decreased significantly.

The current "goto" platform for this is the "M5STACK", since this platform provides lots of on board I/Os and extension modules necessarry for the required inputs.
